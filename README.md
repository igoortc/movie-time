# movieTime 🎞
This is a simple project written in React ⚛️ (and Redux Saga) that searches movies from [an API](https://developers.themoviedb.org) and lists the results. By clicking on a poster, more information about the movie will be displayed.

I used [hops](https://github.com/xing/hops) as boilerplate.

```
git clone https://github.com/igoortc/movie-time.git
cd movie-time
npm install
```
