# movieTime 🎞
This is a simple project written in React ⚛️ (and Redux Saga) that searches movies from [an API](https://developers.themoviedb.org) and lists the results. If you click on a poster, you'll get more info on the movie.

I used [hops](https://github.com/xing/hops) as boilerplate.

```
git clone https://github.com/igoortc/movie-time.git
cd movie-time
npm install
```
